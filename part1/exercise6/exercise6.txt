\*
Create a Dockerfile that starts with FROM devopsdockeruh/overwrite_cmd_exercise. 
Add a CMD line to the Dockerfile.

The developer has poorly documented how the application works. 
Nevertheless once you will execute an application (run a container from an image) you will have some clues on how it works. 
Your task is to run an application so that it will simulate a clock functionality.

When you will build an image tag it as “docker-clock” so that docker run docker-clock starts the application.

Return both Dockerfile(s) and the command you used to run the container(s)
