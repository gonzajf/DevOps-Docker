/*
A good developer creates well written READMEs that can be used to create Dockerfiles with ease.
Clone, fork or download a project from https://github.com/docker-hy/frontend-example-docker.
Create a Dockerfile for the project and give a command so that the project runs in a docker container with port 5000 exposed and published so when you start the container and navigate to http://localhost:5000 you will see message if youâ€™re successful.
Submit the Dockerfile.
As in other exercises, do not alter the code of the project
